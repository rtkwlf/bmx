## Contributing

*Members of the AWN (rtkwlf) organization should consult internal documentation on contribution guidelines for repositories within rtkwlf.*

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure that all tests pass.
5. Squash commits into one meaningful change per commit.
6. Submit a pull request to this repository. Wait for tests to run and someone to chime in.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rtkwlf/bmx/issues)

This repository uses GitHub issues to track public bugs. Members of the AWN (rtkwlf) organization should use our internal ticketing system, rather than using GitHub issues.

Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Coding Style

This repository is configured with [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) rules and contributions should make use of them.
