# Try Out Development Containers: Go

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This environment includes bazel and is intended to assist with isolation of bmx development to not interfere with existing bmx configurations.

## Setting up the development container

### VS Code Remote - Containers

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
3. Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
